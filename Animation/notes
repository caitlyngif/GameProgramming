mixamo for characters and animations

download the animation with skin. xbot or ybot is a smaller download.

character > component in unity > animator
needs this to be animated
don't add "animation" component (different from animator) to complex models
animator has different states

also needs animator controller component
need one of these for every state machine
double click in project
cannot delete, but can create new states
    create state > empty
    creates default state of the character (idle)
    set the motion for that state to map it to an actual animation clip (not the animation file itself, expand the file, find the animation that has a triangle icon)
    that's the actual animation clip that you can set in the motion in inspector

set the controller in the animator

create new state
right click, make transition, choose other state
can click on the transition to get information about the two states
can customize how long the transition is
Some animations have an exit time. if i pick up a cup, its finished, if i put down the cup, it's finished
idle doesn't finish, it loops. no exit time. 
specify in transition inspect whether it has an exit time. if i have it check marked, it will do one iteration and then automatically transition to next state
